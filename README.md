# Freebitbot

Automate claiming the reward from [freebitco.in](https://freebitco.in/).


# Usage

Install the dependencies on your python environment, then run:

```py
python bot.py
```

You could also modify the shebang with the full path to your python executable and then run it as:

```py
./bot.py
```

I symlinked the `bot.py` file to my path under the name `fbb` so I could run it from anywhere without needing to activate the virtual environment first.
